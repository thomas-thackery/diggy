# diggy 

### What's it for? ###
Script to get A and AAAA from platform domain. Returns tidy output for hamsters. 

### Installation ###
Put _diggy_ in a directory where your projects live, e.g. `/usr/local/bin` and make sure there's a path to this directory in your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`) like ```export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"```. You might need to make the file executable by running `chmod +x` on it. On my machine, I renamed to just _diggy_ and dropped the `.sh` extension. 

### Can you dig it ###
To run, just enter `diggy` and, when prompted, paste in the platform domain. The output will be the A and AAAA Records.

Note, this is designed to work with the platform domain only. Other domains will yield unknown results and hamsters could be injuredâ€”just sayin'.
