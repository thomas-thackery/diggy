# diggy 
Script to get A and AAAA from platform domain. Returns tidy output for hamsters. 

Put _diggy_ in a directory where your projects live, e.g. /usr/local/bin and make sure there's a path to this directory in your shell configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, .bash_profile) like ```export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"```. You might need to make the file executable by running ```chmod +x``` on it. On my machine, I renamed to just _diggy_ and dropped the .sh extension. 

Note, this is designed to work with the platform domain only. Other domains will yield unknown results and hamsters could be injuredâ€”just sayin'.
