# Use case: Some customers cannot use CNAMEs for their
#  subdomains and need IP addresses. This outputs the A and AAAA records 
#  in a way that can copied and pasted for the customer. 
# Approach comes frome DTS
# Inputs: Platform domain with or without http:// and trailing / 
# Output: 
# A     <IP Address>
# AAAA  <IP Address>
# AAAA  <IP Address>
#
